# Laravel + VueJS CRUD
This is my first serious attempt to learn how to use VueJS in a situation that is more or less common to every project: 
Create, Read, Update and Delete resources.
This is not supposed to be a gold standard for code quality but a way to get things to work in a simple yet effective manner.

## Installation
- Download or clone the project only if you meet the minimun Laravel 5.5 requirements
- In a Terminal window, navigate to your root folder and run `composer install`
